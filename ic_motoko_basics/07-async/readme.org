#+RESULTS:

- ??? A shared function call that executes without executing an await expression never suspends and executes atomically. A shared function that contains no await expression is syntactically atomic.
- A trap will only revoke changes made since the last commit point. In particular, in a non-atomic function that does multiple awaits, a trap will only revoke changes attempted since the last await - all preceding effects will have been committed and cannot be undone.
